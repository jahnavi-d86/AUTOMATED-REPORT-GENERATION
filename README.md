This task involves building a Python-based solution to automate the generation of a report from raw data. The project reads solar power plant data from a CSV file, analyzes it using statistical methods, and creates a well-structured PDF report.

Key highlights include:
- Auto-detection of timestamp and power output columns
- Parsing of non-standard date formats (e.g., 13.01.2024-00:00)
- Calculation of mean, max, standard deviation, and other key metrics
- Identification of high-power generation periods based on dynamic thresholds
- Visualization of power output over time using matplotlib
- Embedding of the chart and insights into a downloadable PDF report

This task showcases data analysis, visualization, and reporting automation using pandas, matplotlib, and fpdf, all executed in a user-friendly Google Colab environment.
